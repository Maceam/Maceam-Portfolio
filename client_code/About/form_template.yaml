      \ see you here. I am a Maysam, a professional Communications Designer as well\
      \ as  a Data Analyst in training. My interest is in building solutions through\
      \ a data driven, experimental and collaborative approach to the problem at hand.\
      \ I believe in creating things that break expectations - things which diverge\
      \ from the norm, being able to continuously practise, iterate, learn, glitch\
      \ and experiment are the essence of life. \n\nIf I'm not working on personal\
      \ projects you can often find me doing photography, reading, brewing coffee\
      \ or playing the odd video game to unwind.\n\nI am always open to collaboration\
      \ and communication so please feel free to send me an email or contact me directly\
      \ through the website. I look forward to hearing from you. ", font: '', spacing_above: small,
